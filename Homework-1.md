# Overview 

* Company Name: Coinbase

* Incorporated on June 2012

* Founders:

  * Brian Armstrong, a former Airbnb engineer

# Origin of Coinbase: 
Working as a young engineer ar Airbnb, Brian Armstrong became fascinated with bitcoin. He saw the potential of bitcoin as a technology to make anonymous, encrypted, government-free online version of money. He believed bitcoin could be faster, more secure, and cheaper than typical finicial networks. Brian eventually met Ben Reeves, a British programmer who ran a Blockchain, a website technology that tracked bitchoin transitions. The two hit it off, Reeves was an expert in the technology and began creating a "Paypal for Bitcoin." 

To generate revenue, this website would serve as a trusted broker of multiple cyptocurrencies and take a 0.5% charge anytime anyone converted dollars to bitcoin or vice versa. 

After pitching this idea to prestigous investors and startup groups, they where on there way to sucess. However, the relationship began to crumble due to conflicting views of the direction of the company. Armstrong felt that users needed a secure password verification. Thus Coinbase would have to retain access to users' private keys. Reeves saw this as a direct violation of the purpose bitcoin. To him, the whole point of bitcoin was the Bitcoin user is in complete control of their money. If you gave some company access to your bitcoins, you were essentially trusting it as you would a bank which could empty the users account and created security issues if hacked. This disagreement proved fatal to their relationship. Armstrong took Reeves out of their shared accounts. He then flew to Silicon Valley and started Coinbase with other partners.

# Business Activities:

## The Problem
The things that make Bitcoin attractive: security through blockchain, unregulated, government-free, also made it very difficult for non-coders to understand and use. Such technology requires confusing software in the form of "wallets." Additionally, bitcoin can be very difficult to obtain, generally potential buyers would rely on a unregulated middleman. This can lead to people being scammed and makes it difficult to spend as well. 

## Coinbase Solution
Coinbase would offer a solution to these problems. It would attract new non-coder customers to crypotcurrency by making an easy to use digital wallet with cryptocurrency. You could pay for good and services quickly with ur smartphone using crypotcurrency. Users can easily create a Coinbase account. Once a bank account has been linked, users can now begin trading instantaneously.

Other technologies do not have such a technology to easily buy, sell, and trade cyrptocurrency with such high security. Armstrong believed security is the most important aspect. The company maintains high security as 98% of all assests are held in offline storage the company's Coinbase wallet, while the remaining 2% is held by the company for trading and at more risk for potential hacks. This acts as a insurance policy to prevent massive potential security losses. 

With such easy and security, Coinbase has the potential to attract a huge market of potential users. This market is potentially as large as all online digital banking which has a current market size $8 Trillion. However, competing with national banks and typical finicial networks is still in the distance future. Currently, Coinbase has several main competitors in the crypotcurrency field. This competitors are as followed: 
1. Robinhood
  * Advantages: Much like coinbase Robinhood allows the user to buy and sell Bitcoin/Altcoin and does it for 0% purchasing fees. 
  * Disadvantages: Cannot trade Bitcoin/Altcoins and cannot be used in 15 states.
2. Gemini
  * Advantages: Does everything Coinbase does but fee charges lower with larger purchases.
  * Disadvantages: Small purchases subjected to higher fees.
3. Sofi Invest
  * Advantages: Cannot deposit or withdraw cryptocurrency via your account, leading to less risk of your coins being hacked.
  * Disadvantages: Cannot use crypto markets, low fee structure. 
4. Cash App
  * Advantages: Low fee structure and can withdraw Bitcoin for use.
  * Disadvantages: Lacks other AltCoins. 
5. Abra
  * Advantages: Low purchasing fees can buy, sell, and trad Bitcoin and Altcoin. 
  * Disadvantages: Generates exchange rate income on the spread between different currencies.

# The Technology
Coinbase utilizes blockchain technology as any other technology. However In order to develop further, Coinbase aimed to function their technology like a real bank. They acquired the blockchain explorer service Blockr and the web bookmarking company Kippt. Coinbase uses the insurance market of Lloyd’s of London, and its security department employs 41 professionals, including an Iraqi war veteran who is responsible for guarding the “physical” office and a PhD in cryptography who also protects the “digital” space of the exchange.



# Landscape:

The landscape of cyrptocurrency is constantly growing and expanding. Coinbase has grown from trading just Bitcoin to all Altcoins. This landscape is expanding to all the average user the ability to exchange coins as easily as the dollar while maintianing high security. 


# Results

So far the company offers the ability to buy/sell in 32 countries, while the cryptocurrency wallet is available in 190 countries. With over 35 million verified users and $320 billion worth of crypto assets traded in its platform, Coinbase has cemented itself as the largest US-based crypto management provider.


# Recommendations

Coinbase should continue to establish itself as a cryptocurrency bank with easy user functionality and security for the users. Continuing finding ways to make crptocurrency as easy to use as digital currency is the key to success.
